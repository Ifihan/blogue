It is well established that Python has become one of the most popular programming languages. Created by Guido Van Rossum in 1989, it is beginner friendly and easy to read. Python is also portable, extensible and embeddable, object-oriented and functional, and an interpreted high-level language. There are a lot of areas Python can be used and in this article, I will be talking about some of the applications. 

### 1. Data Science.
Python can also be used to perform data analysis for specific purposes, extract, and draw insight from data. Libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn to create beautiful graphs. Pandas for data manipulation, can be used.

### 2. Machine Learning/AI.
In this field, Python is the most popular language used. With great libraries like Pandas, Numpy, TensorFlow, Matplotlib, Keras and the likes built with Python, ML applications are created with relative ease. Also, AI/ML applications require a language that is stable, secure, and flexible. Python has all these qualities.

### 3. Scripting.
Scripting is used to automate the execution of tasks that could be done by humans. Since the languages used for scripting are rather interpreted than compiled, Python comes in handy as it is known for speed. 

### 4. Web Development.
When it comes to web development, Python can be your go-to tool. Why? This is because Python web frameworks are known for scalability, security, and flexibility. There are tons of libraries for web development but the most popular ones are: Django and Flask. We have other frameworks such as Bottle, Pyramid, Web2py, and CherryPy.

### 5. Web scraping.
For extracting information from the web, Python comes in handy for that. It is easy to use and has great tools for that. Some of them are: BeautifulSoup, Scrapy, Selenium, and Urlib.

### 6. Game development.
For developing interactive games, there are libraries for that in Python. PySoy (a 3D game engine that supports Python 3) and PyGame are two Python-based libraries used widely for game development.

### 7. Desktop GUI.
Python offers many Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs) toolkits and frameworks that can be used in desktop application development. PyQt, Kivy, Tkinter, PyGUI, and PySide are some of the best Python-based GUI frameworks that allow developers to create highly functional GUIs.

### 8. Cybersecurity.
Python is an extremely useful programming language for cybersecurity professionals because it can perform a multitude of cybersecurity functions, including malware analysis, scanning, and penetration testing.

### 9. Raspberry pi.
As Python is known for its versatility, it can also be used to program a Raspberry pi. The Raspberry Pi Foundation specifically selected Python as the main language because of its power, versatility, and ease of use. Python comes preinstalled on Raspbian, so youâ€™ll be ready to start from the get-go.

With this article, it is safe to say that Python is very versatile and can perform almost any development.

Picking it as your main language is highly recommended as it would make it easy to delve into or switch to any field without hassle.
