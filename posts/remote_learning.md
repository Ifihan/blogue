A Remote learning setting is any setting in which the student and the educator/instructor are not in the same room or environment as in the traditional classroom setting. Instead, information is relayed over a distance and to a possibly wider audience through various media such as websites, blogs, video conferencing and even through audio.

In recent times, due to the current pandemic ravaging the world, remote learning has never been more widely sought after. We have been forcefully confined to our homes without access to the traditional settings for learning, thus making remote learning the safest means by which learning can still take place without putting the lives of the students, teachers and general public at risk.

With that said, remote learning can often be daunting, and sometimes confusing; with so many possible fields and available learning platforms in contrast to the limited  time, financial strength and focus available, a guide can sometimes be necessary. 
Relating this to tech, there are a lot of things people would want to do and learn and have no clue on how to start most times.

I'll be sharing a few tips on how to effectively leverage on remote learning platforms, and achieve optimal results.

1. Pick an interest: This is a very important step. Deciding on what you would want to learn is essential to prevent wasting resources, wasting time and ending in frustration. So decide on what you would want to learn and also what you would want to achieve after learning it before committing to any course.

2. Set a realistic goal: Realistic goals are goals that are achievable after putting the resources, skills, and time available into consideration. Setting a realistic goal would help direct your focus and guide you in planning towards learning efficiently.

3. Planning and Scheduling: Pick a time range which you would dedicate to studying and create a schedule around it. Work diligently and passionately during these times and try to stick to your schedule as much as possible. Avoid procrastination, it steals time.

4. Work on projects: During and after your set goal, work on projects. This helps to track  your progress and gives you something tangible to show for your efforts. Implement whatever you have learnt over time.
 
### Productivity Tips

You can only be successful if you are productive during the time youâ€™ve dedicated to studying. Here are some productivity tips you can follow:

1. Do not read close to your sleeping area. 
2. To improve your productivity, create a schedule that suits both your project and your work style. Schedules help you stay organised.  
3. Rest when you are fatigued. You will find you are more productive afterwards.
4. Eat when it is right, not when you feel like it. 
5. Effective communication is important for the success of any group task. Use social platforms like Slack, Zoom, or WhatsApp to stay connected with your teammates. 
6. Self-imposed deadlines help to curb procrastination. 
7. The best way to focus is by avoiding distractions.
